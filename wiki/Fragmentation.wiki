#RFA file format quick description

= Introduction =

The RFA file format is a standalone file system, this page will try to explain you how data is hierarchised. In following explanations we are talking about a RFA archive that contains 5 files named a, b, c, d and e.

= RFA file structure =

Data and entries are stored in the same file, the RFA archive.

Data are not directly readable, because you need to know how they are organized. This organization is given by the entries table that can be found at the end of the file.

Two other informations exist outside the data and entries structure, they are the data size and the quantity of entries that can be found in the table.
With them, we can directly move our reading cursor at the start of the table and identify data.
